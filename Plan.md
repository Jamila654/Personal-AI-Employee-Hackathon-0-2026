# Plan

1.  **Understand the Goal:** I will first analyze the request to fully understand the user's objective.
2.  **Gather Information:** If necessary, I will ask clarifying questions or use tools to gather more context about the project and the user's needs.
3.  **Formulate a Strategy:** I will break down the task into smaller, manageable steps.
4.  **Draft Content:** I will create initial drafts of any required documents or code.
5.  **Submit for Review:** All drafts will be placed in the `Pending_Approval/` directory for your review and feedback.
6.  **Incorporate Feedback:** I will revise the drafts based on your feedback.
7.  **Finalize:** Once approved, I will move the final versions to the appropriate location (e.g., `Done/`).

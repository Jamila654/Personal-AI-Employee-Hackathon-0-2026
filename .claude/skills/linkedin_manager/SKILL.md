# LinkedIn Manager

## CRITICAL RULES - READ BEFORE WRITING
1. **ZERO LABELS**: Never use "Headline:", "Body:", "Call to Action:", or "Hashtags:". Start the file immediately with the first sentence of the post.
2. **NO BOLDING**: Do not use `**` asterisks. Use plain text only. 
3. **HUMAN FORMATTING**: Use short sentences and double line breaks between paragraphs.
4. **LIMIT HASHTAGS**: Exactly 3 hashtags at the very bottom.
5. **NO LOGOS/MARKDOWN**: Just plain, readable text.

## Action
Draft the requested post and save it to `Pending_Approval/post.md`.
